## API Endpoints

### 1. Create Login Streak Log

Creates a log entry for 7-day and 15-day login streaks with automatic streak calculation.

**Endpoint:** `GET /gemLog/create7dayAnd15DayLogs`

**Authorization:** Player only

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": 1,
  "data": {
    "message": "Logged day 5 of login streak",
    "log": {
      "id": 1,
      "created_by_id": 123,
      "gem_rule_id": 1,
      "streak": 5,
      "claimed": 0,
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    "streak": 5
  }
}
```

    "streak": 5
  }
}
```

**DFD:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Validate JWT}
    B -->|Invalid| C[401 Unauthorized]
    B -->|Valid| D{Check Player Role}
    D -->|Denied| E[403 Forbidden]
    D -->|Allowed| F[Extract User ID]
    F --> G[Fetch Gem Rules]
    G --> H{Check Today's Login}
    H -->|Exists| I[Return Already Logged]
    H -->|Not Exists| J[Check Last Login]

    L --> M[Insert Log Entry]
    M -->|Success| N[200 Success Response]
    M -->|Fail| O[500 Database Error]
```

#### Business Logic

1. **Rule Fetching**: Retrieves 7-day and 15-day login streak rules
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks if user already logged in today
3. **Streak Calculation**: Calculates streak based on last login date
4. **Rule Matching**: Associates appropriate rule based on streak count
5. **Streak Reset**: Resets streak to 1 if gap > 1 day or streak > 15
6. **Player Only**: Restricted to player users

#### Database Operations

```sql
-- Fetch gem rules
SELECT title, id FROM gem_rule WHERE is_deleted IS DISTINCT FROM 1;

-- Check today's login
SELECT created_at, streak FROM gem_log 
WHERE created_by_id = $1 AND DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE 
AND gem_rule_id = ANY($2) ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check last login
SELECT created_at, streak FROM gem_log 
WHERE created_by_id = $1 AND DATE(created_at) < CURRENT_DATE 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Insert new log
INSERT INTO gem_log (created_by_id, streak, gem_rule_id) 
VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING *;
```

---

### 2. Create Game Play Log

Creates a log entry for game play activities with duplicate prevention.

**Endpoint:** `POST /gemLog/game-played`

**Authorization:** Player only

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "ruleId": 19,
  "play_game_id": 1
}
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": 1,
  "data": {
    "log": {
      "id": 1,
      "created_by_id": 123,
      "gem_rule_id": 19,
      "claimed": 0,
      "play_game_id": 1,
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    "claimed": 0
  }
}
```

**Already Played Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": 1,
  "data": {
    "message": "Already played a game today for this rule",
    "log": {
      "id": 1,
      "created_by_id": 123,
      "gem_rule_id": 19,
      "claimed": 0,
      "play_game_id": 1,
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**Error Response (500):**
```json
{
  "status": 0,
  "message": "Internal server error"
}
```

**DFD:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Validate JWT}
    B -->|Invalid| C[401 Unauthorized]
    B -->|Valid| D{Check Player Role}
    D -->|Denied| E[403 Forbidden]
    D -->|Allowed| F[Extract Request Data]
    F --> G[Check Today's Game Play]
    G -->|Exists| H[Return Already Played]
    G -->|Not Exists| I[Insert Game Play Log]
    I --> J{Rule ID = 19?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Insert Additional Rule 20 Log]
    J -->|No| L[Skip Additional Log]
    K --> M[200 Success Response]
    L --> M
    I -->|Fail| N[500 Database Error]
```

#### Business Logic

1. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks if user already played today for this rule
2. **Game Play Logging**: Creates log entry for game play activity
3. **Special Rule Handling**: Automatically creates rule 20 log when rule 19 is triggered
4. **Claim Status**: Sets claimed to 0 by default
5. **Player Only**: Restricted to player users

#### Database Operations

```sql
-- Check today's game play
SELECT * FROM gem_log 
WHERE created_by_id = $1 AND gem_rule_id = $2 
AND play_game_id = $3 AND DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Insert game play log
INSERT INTO gem_log (created_by_id, gem_rule_id, claimed, play_game_id) 
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4) RETURNING *;

-- Insert additional rule 20 log (when rule 19 is triggered)
INSERT INTO gem_log (created_by_id, gem_rule_id, claimed, play_game_id) 
VALUES ($1, 20, 0, $2) RETURNING *;
```

## Rate Limiting

| Endpoint                | Rate Limit | Window      |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|
| All Gem Log APIs        | 100        | 15 minutes  |

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT token validation on all endpoints
- Token expiration handling
- Secure token transmission

### Authorization
- Role-based access control for player users only
- Player-specific data access
- Log ownership validation

### Input Validation
- Request body validation
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Input sanitization

### Data Protection
- Player-only access to gem logs
- User-specific log creation
- Input sanitization

---

## Business Rules

### Login Streak Management
1. Users can only log one login per day per rule
2. Streak calculation based on consecutive days
3. Streak resets to 1 if gap > 1 day
4. Maximum streak capped at 15 days
5. Automatic rule association based on streak count

### Game Play Logging
1. Users can only log one game play per day per rule
2. Game play logs are unclaimed by default
3. Special handling for rule 19 (triggers rule 20)
4. Play game ID tracking for specific games

### Data Integrity
1. Foreign key relationships are maintained
2. Duplicate prevention for daily activities
3. Audit trails track log creation
4. Soft delete support

### Validation Rules
1. User ID must reference an existing user
2. Rule ID must reference an existing gem rule
3. Game ID must reference an existing game (if provided)
4. Tournament ID must reference an existing tournament (if provided)

---

## Monitoring & Logging

### Metrics to Monitor
- API response times
- Error rates by endpoint
- Database query performance
- Login streak creation rates
- Game play log creation rates
- Player activity patterns

### Logging
- Request/response logging
- Error logging with stack traces
- Database operation logging
- Gem log lifecycle event logging

### Alerts
- High error rates (>5%)
- Slow response times (>2s)
- Database connection issues
- Failed gem log operations

---

## Integration Examples

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// Create login streak log
const createLoginStreakLog = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/gemLog/create7dayAnd15DayLogs', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
  });
  return response.json();
};

// Create game play log
const createGamePlayLog = async (ruleId, playGameId = null) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/gemLog/game-played', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      ruleId: ruleId,
      play_game_id: playGameId
    })
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

### Error Handling

```javascript
const handleGemLogOperation = async (operation) => {
  try {
    const result = await operation();
    if (result.status === 1) {
      console.log('Operation successful:', result.data);
      return result.data;
    } else {
      console.error('Operation failed:', result.message);
      throw new Error(result.message);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Gem log operation failed:', error.message);
    // Handle different error types
    if (error.message.includes('Already logged in today')) {
      // Handle duplicate login
    } else if (error.message.includes('Already played a game today')) {
      // Handle duplicate game play
    } else if (error.message.includes('No applicable login streak rule')) {
      // Handle missing rules
    } else if (error.message.includes('Unauthorized')) {
      // Handle authentication error
    } else if (error.message.includes('Forbidden')) {
      // Handle authorization error
    } else {
      // Handle general error
    }
  }
};
```
