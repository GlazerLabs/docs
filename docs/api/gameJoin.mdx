## API Endpoints

### 1. Join Multiple Games

Joins multiple games with specified status for the authenticated user.

**Endpoint:** `POST /gameJoin/create`

**Authorization:** Player only

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "game_ids": [1, 2, 3],
  "status": "playing"
}
```

**Success Response (201):**
```json
{
  "status": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "game_id": 1,
      "created_by_id": 123,
      "status": "playing",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "game_id": 2,
      "created_by_id": 123,
      "status": "playing",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Error Response (400):**
```json
{
  "status": 0,
  "message": "Failed to insert record into the database."
}
```

**DFD:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Validate JWT}
    B -->|Invalid| C[401 Unauthorized]
    B -->|Valid| D{Check Player Role}
    D -->|Denied| E[403 Forbidden]
    D -->|Allowed| F[Validate Input Schema]
    F -->|Invalid| G[400 Bad Request]
    F -->|Valid| H[Process Each Game ID]
    H --> I[Check Existing Joins]
    I -->|Exists| J[Return Existing Join]
    I -->|Not Exists| K[Create New Join]
    K -->|Success| L[201 Success Response]
    K -->|Fail| M[400 Database Error]
```

#### Business Logic

1. **Input Validation**: Validates required fields and data types
2. **Concurrent Processing**: Processes multiple game IDs concurrently
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing joins before creating new ones
4. **Status Management**: Sets default status to "playing" if not provided
5. **Creator Tracking**: Records who joined the games

#### Database Operations

```sql
-- Check existing join
SELECT * FROM game_join WHERE game_id = $1 AND created_by_id = $2;

-- Insert new join
INSERT INTO game_join (game_id, created_by_id, status) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING *;
```

---

### 2. Get Joined Games

Retrieves all games joined by the authenticated user with optional filtering.

**Endpoint:** `GET /gameJoin/read`

**Authorization:** Player only

**Query Parameters:**
- `game_id` (optional): Filter by specific game ID

**Example Request:**
```http
GET /gameJoin/read?game_id=1
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "game_id": 1,
      "created_by_id": 123,
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "is_deleted": 0,
      "deleted_by_id": null,
      "status": "playing",
      "title": "PUBG Mobile",
      "description": "Battle Royale mobile game",
      "image_url": "https://example.com/pubg.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Error Response (400):**
```json
{
  "status": 0,
  "message": "Failed to retrieve joined games."
}
```

**DFD:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Validate JWT}
    B -->|Invalid| C[401 Unauthorized]
    B -->|Valid| D{Check Player Role}
    D -->|Denied| E[403 Forbidden]
    D -->|Allowed| F[Extract User ID & Query Parameters]
    F --> G[Query Joined Games with Game Details]
    G -->|Success| H[200 Success Response]
    G -->|Fail| I[400 Database Error]
```

#### Business Logic

1. **User-Specific**: Only returns games joined by the authenticated user
2. **Game Details**: Includes game title, description, and image
3. **Optional Filtering**: Supports filtering by specific game ID
4. **BGMI Exclusion**: Excludes 'BGMI' game from results

#### Database Operations

```sql
SELECT 
  game_join.*, 
  game.title AS game_title, 
  game.description AS game_description, 
  game.image_url AS game_image_url 
FROM game_join 
LEFT JOIN game ON game_join.game_id = game.id 
WHERE game.title != 'BGMI' AND game_join.created_by_id = $1 
  ${game_id ? "AND game_join.game_id = $2" : ""};
```

---

### 3. Update Game Join Status

Updates the status of a joined game.

**Endpoint:** `PATCH /gameJoin/update`

**Authorization:** Player only

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "game_id": 1,
  "newStatus": "played"
}
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": 1,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "game_id": 1,
    "created_by_id": 123,
    "status": "played",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-15T12:30:00Z",
    "general_id": 1
  }
}
```

**Error Response (404):**
```json
{
  "status": 0,
  "message": "No joined game found to update."
}
```

**DFD:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Validate JWT}
    B -->|Invalid| C[401 Unauthorized]
    B -->|Valid| D{Check Player Role}
    D -->|Denied| E[403 Forbidden]
    D -->|Allowed| F[Validate Status Values]
    F -->|Invalid| G[400 Bad Request]
    F -->|Valid| H[Update Game Join Status]
    H -->|Not Found| I[404 Not Found]
    H -->|Success| J[200 Success Response]
    H -->|Fail| K[400 Database Error]
```

#### Business Logic

1. **Status Validation**: Validates status against allowed values (wishlist, playing, played)
2. **Player Only**: Restricted to player users
3. **Existence Check**: Verifies game join exists before update
4. **Status Update**: Updates only the status field

#### Database Operations

```sql
UPDATE game_join 
SET status = $3, updated_at = NOW() 
WHERE game_id = $1 AND created_by_id = $2 
RETURNING *;
```

---

### 4. Delete Game Join

Deletes a game join (hard delete).

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /gameJoin/delete`

**Authorization:** Player only

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "game_id": 1
}
```

**Success Response (204):**
```json
{
  "status": 1,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "game_id": 1,
    "created_by_id": 123
  }
}
```

**Error Response (404):**
```json
{
  "status": 0,
  "message": "No joined game found to delete."
}
```

**DFD:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Validate JWT}
    B -->|Invalid| C[401 Unauthorized]
    B -->|Valid| D{Check Player Role}
    D -->|Denied| E[403 Forbidden]
    D -->|Allowed| F[Extract Game ID]
    F --> G[Delete Game Join]
    G -->|Not Found| H[404 Not Found]
    G -->|Success| I[204 Success Response]
    G -->|Fail| J[400 Database Error]
```

#### Business Logic

1. **Hard Delete**: Permanently removes the game join record
2. **Player Only**: Restricted to player users
3. **Existence Check**: Verifies game join exists before deletion

#### Database Operations

```sql
DELETE FROM game_join 
WHERE game_id = $1 AND created_by_id = $2 
RETURNING *;
```

---

### 5. Search Not Joined Games

Searches for games that the user has not joined.

**Endpoint:** `GET /gameJoin/not-present`

**Authorization:** Player only

**Query Parameters:**
- `keyword` (optional): Search keyword
- `page` (optional): Page number (default: 1)
- `limit` (optional): Items per page (default: 10)

**Example Request:**
```http
GET /gameJoin/not-present?keyword=battle&page=1&limit=10
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 4,
      "title": "Call of Duty Mobile",
      "description": "Battle Royale FPS game",
      "image_url": "https://example.com/cod.jpg",
      "team_eligible": 1
    }
  ],
  "pageNumber": 1,
  "limit": 10
}
```

**Error Response (400):**
```json
{
  "status": 0,
  "message": "Failed to search games."
}
```

**DFD:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Validate JWT}
    B -->|Invalid| C[401 Unauthorized]
    B -->|Valid| D{Check Player Role}
    D -->|Denied| E[403 Forbidden]
    D -->|Allowed| F[Extract Query Parameters]
    F --> G[Search Not Joined Games]
    G -->|Success| H[200 Success Response]
    G -->|Fail| I[400 Database Error]
```

#### Business Logic

1. **Exclusion Logic**: Excludes games already joined by the user
2. **Search Functionality**: Case-insensitive search by title or description
3. **Pagination**: Efficient offset-based pagination
4. **BGMI Exclusion**: Excludes 'BGMI' game from results

#### Database Operations

```sql
WITH x AS (
  SELECT * FROM game 
  WHERE is_deleted IS DISTINCT FROM 1 
    AND title != 'BGMI' 
    AND id NOT IN (SELECT game_id FROM game_join WHERE created_by_id = $1)
)
SELECT * FROM x 
WHERE title ILIKE $2 OR description ILIKE $2 
ORDER BY id DESC 
LIMIT $3 OFFSET $4;
```

```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 4,
      "title": "Call of Duty Mobile",
      "description": "Battle Royale FPS game",
      "image_url": "https://example.com/cod.jpg",
      "team_eligible": 1,
      "totalGames": 15
    }
  ],
  "pageNumber": 1,
  "limit": 10
}
```

**Error Response (400):**
```json
{
  "status": 0,
  "message": "Failed to retrieve unselected games."
}
```

**DFD:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Validate JWT}
    B -->|Invalid| C[401 Unauthorized]
    B -->|Valid| D{Check Player Role}
    D -->|Denied| E[403 Forbidden]
    D -->|Allowed| F[Extract Query Parameters]
    F --> G[Get Total Count]
    G --> H[Query Unselected Games]
    H -->|Success| I[200 Success Response]

```

#### Business Logic

1. **Complex Query**: Uses CTEs for efficient data aggregation
2. **Team Information**: Includes team count and roles
3. **Tournament Data**: Includes tournament count and awards
4. **Game Details**: Includes in-game ID and username
5. **Team Eligibility**: Only includes team-eligible games

#### Database Operations

```sql
WITH 
    g AS (SELECT * FROM game WHERE team_eligible = 1),
    t AS (SELECT * FROM team WHERE game_id IN (SELECT id FROM g)),
    tm AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS team_count FROM team_member WHERE team_id IN (SELECT id FROM t) AND user_id = $1 AND role IN ('Team Lead', 'member', 'substitute')),
    tmd AS (SELECT role, team_id FROM team_member WHERE team_id IN (SELECT id FROM t) AND user_id = $1 AND role IN ('Team Lead', 'member', 'substitute') ORDER BY team_id DESC LIMIT 1),
    tr_ids AS (SELECT tournament_id FROM tournament_register WHERE team_id IN (SELECT id FROM t)),
    tr AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS tournament_count FROM tr_ids),
    tra_raw AS (SELECT * FROM tournament_award WHERE (team_id IN (SELECT id FROM t) AND tournament_id IN (SELECT tournament_id FROM tr_ids)) OR (user_id = $1 AND tournament_id IN (SELECT tournament_id FROM tr_ids)) ORDER by tournament_id OFFSET $2 LIMIT $3),
    tra AS (SELECT COALESCE(json_agg(tra_raw), '[]'::json) AS awards FROM tra_raw),
    gj AS (SELECT in_game_name, in_game_id, created_by_id, id, game_id FROM game_join WHERE created_by_id = $1 AND game_id IN (SELECT id FROM g))
SELECT g.*, tm.team_count, gj.in_game_id, gj.in_game_name, tr.tournament_count, tra.awards
FROM g
LEFT JOIN gj ON gj.game_id = g.id, tm, tmd, tr, tra;

### 8. Get Game Profile Detail by Game ID

Retrieves detailed profile information for a specific game.

**Endpoint:** `GET /gameJoin/game-profile-detail`

**Authorization:** Player only

**Query Parameters:**
- `game_id` (required): Game ID to get details for

**Example Request:**
```http
GET /gameJoin/game-profile-detail?game_id=1
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": 1,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "PUBG Mobile",
    "description": "Battle Royale mobile game",
    "image_url": "https://example.com/pubg.jpg",
    "team_eligible": 1,
    "types": ["battle_royale", "mobile", "fps"]
  }
}
```

**Error Response (400):**
```json
{
  "status": 0,
  "message": "Failed to retrieve game profile detail."
}
```

**DFD:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Validate JWT}
    B -->|Invalid| C[401 Unauthorized]
    B -->|Valid| D{Check Player Role}
    D -->|Denied| E[403 Forbidden]
    D -->|Allowed| F[Extract Game ID]
    F --> G[Query Game Profile Detail]
    G -->|Success| H[200 Success Response]
    G -->|Fail| I[400 Database Error]
```

#### Business Logic

1. **Game Details**: Returns comprehensive game information
2. **Mapping Types**: Includes game mapping types as array
3. **Existence Check**: Returns null if game not found

#### Database Operations

```sql
SELECT g.*, ARRAY_AGG(gtm.type) AS types 
FROM game g 
LEFT JOIN game_mapping_type gtm ON g.id = gtm.game_id 
WHERE g.id = $1 
GROUP BY g.id;
```

## Rate Limiting

| Endpoint                | Rate Limit | Window      |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|
| All Game Join APIs      | 100        | 15 minutes  |

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT token validation on all endpoints
- Token expiration handling
- Secure token transmission

### Authorization
- Role-based access control for player users
- User-specific data access
- Game join ownership validation

### Input Validation
- Request body validation using Joi schemas
- Query parameter validation
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Input sanitization

### Data Protection
- User-specific game join access
- Unique constraints on user-game combinations
- Input sanitization

---

## Business Rules

### Game Joining
1. Users can join multiple games with different statuses
2. Each user can only join a game once (unique constraint)
3. Game joins are user-specific and cannot be shared
4. BGMI game is excluded from all operations

### Status Management
1. Game status can be: wishlist, playing, played
2. Status updates are restricted to the game owner
3. Default status is "playing" for new joins

### Game Discovery
1. Users can search for games they haven't joined
2. Search is case-insensitive and supports partial matching
3. Pagination is available for large result sets

### Profile Management
1. Game profiles include team and tournament information
2. Only team-eligible games are included in profiles
3. Profile data is aggregated from multiple related tables

### Data Integrity
1. Foreign key relationships are maintained
2. Unique constraints prevent duplicate joins
3. Audit trails track game join creation and modification

---

## Monitoring & Logging

### Metrics to Monitor
- API response times
- Error rates by endpoint
- Database query performance
- Game join creation and update rates
- Search query performance

### Logging
- Request/response logging
- Error logging with stack traces
- Database operation logging
- Game join lifecycle event logging

### Alerts
- High error rates (>5%)
- Slow response times (>2s)
- Database connection issues
- Failed game join operations

---

const handleGameJoinOperation = async (operation) => {
  try {
    const result = await operation();
    if (result.status === 1) {
      console.log('Operation successful:', result.data);
      return result.data;
    } else {
      console.error('Operation failed:', result.message);
      throw new Error(result.message);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Game join operation failed:', error.message);
    // Handle different error types
    if (error.message.includes('No joined game found')) {
      // Handle not found error
    } else if (error.message.includes('Invalid status')) {
      // Handle validation error
    } else if (error.message.includes('Unauthorized')) {
      // Handle authentication error
    } else if (error.message.includes('Forbidden')) {
      // Handle authorization error
    } else {
      // Handle general error
    }
  }
};
```
